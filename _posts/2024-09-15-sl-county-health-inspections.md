Salt Lake County's Health Department collects great data on different types of establishments' adherence to health and safety guidelines. I thought it'd be interesting to grab this data, specifically for restaurants, and see who are the worst offenders. If you don't share my natural curiosity for this, I'd recommend turning back now. Otherwise, read on for insights on the cleanest (and dirtiest) restaurants in the county as well as some county-wide trends and maps.

# Dataset

The data comes from the [Salt Lake County Health Department's Inspections page](https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/health/inspection/). I scraped this data on 9/14/2024. It includes (up to) the ten most recent inspections for all currently in-business, or recently out-of-business, establishments. The dataset includes **5,311** establishments and **31,745** individual inspections.

## Definitions

The Health Department has two different ways of measuring establishments: a relative **ranking** and an absolute **score**. 

The **ranking** value is expressed as a percentage of establishments with a similar "risk level" that perform worse on health and safety, where all establishments are grouped into one of four risk levels based on probability of contamination. For example, if a sushi restaurant has a ranking of 45%, that means it scores better than 45% of similar establishments (worse than 55%). Higher rankings are better.

The **score** value is a cumulation of strikes against an establishment for health and safety violations, where each strike counts as 1, 3, or 6 points depending on severity. There is no upper limit on an establishment's score. Lower scores are better.

The median score out of all inspections is 12, with 75% of inspections scoring a 24 or lower and 25% of inspections scoring a 5 or lower.

You can read more about rankings, scores, and risk levels on the [Health Department's website](https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/health/food-protection/inspections/).

## Methods

The approach I used to grab the data consists of a simple scraper that submits parameters to the site's ASP.NET form and paginates to retrieve all data. To retrieve latitude and longitude coordinates for mapping purposes, I use the `geopy` package to geocode the provided addresses.

The code can be accessed at [my GitHub](https://github.com/bpewyllie/slc_health_inspections).

# Conclusions

## The Good - highest ranked establishments

Below are the top 5 rankings by type for bar, coffee shop, food truck, and restaurant types. There are a lot of weird records in the data (dog patios, duplicates, and mis-categorized establishments) that I've manually excluded. Remember that high rankings are good, and high scores are bad.

In summary, if you care *solely* about sanitation standards, I'd recommend eating and drinking at high-end hotels and large chains.

### Bars

1. **Alta's Rustler Lodge** (100% rating; max score of 8)
2. **Hilton SLC Lounge** (100%; 12)

## The Bad - lowest ranked establishments

Below are the bottom 5 rankings by type for bar, coffee shop, food truck, and restaurant types. As before, I've manually excluded any unusual data.

In summary, if you care *solely* about sanitation standards, I'd avoid eating and drinking at buffets, smaller mom-and-pop places, and bars in Midvale for some reason.

2. **Old Towne Tavern**, Midvale (1%; 69)
3. **Midway Tavern**, Midvale (3%; 93)

2. **Rise & Grind Coffee**, Midvale (2%; 42)
3. **Higher Ground Coffee**, SLC (4%; 36)
4. **Tres Gatos Coffee**, Midvale (4%; 35)
5. **Beard Papa's**, South Jordan (7%; 30)

### Food Carts & Trucks

2. **El Rey Del Taco**, SLC (0%; 132)
3. **Lulu's Corndogs**, Sandy (0%; 129)

## Overall Trends

### Scores Over Time

### Scores by Geography

See a map below of ranks. There is a rough correlation between both latitude and rank, and longitude and rank, meaning establishments in the northeast corner in the city tend to have better ranks than those in the southeast corner.
